# SomeFramework

SomeFramework is a UI framework full of beautiful ready to use responsive components to create modern user interfaces. SomeFramework allows you to focus more on your code rather than design by providing a large array of styled components.

## Business Model

All of the components within SomeFramework are open source and free to use as you please.  In order to monetize this, we've decided to create a variety of paid SomeFramework themes that you'll be able to purchase and use on your sites.

## License Choice

We've decided to use the MIT license, because we want to allow our users to use SomeFramework as they please whether that's in their sites or as their own sets of themes.
